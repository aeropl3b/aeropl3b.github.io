# Introduction 

Welcome to my page! This is where I will be hosting my portfolio...which is pretty light
at the moment.

My work interests are primarily in simulation and meshing, but my career has taken me to build systems,
CI, rendering, and more! I am excited to put this page together because it allows me to reflect on my
technical experiences and put them into context with my own technical projects and interests.

Apart from technical interests which keep me inside, I break from the computer and explore the outdoors
as much as I can. Whether it be camping, hiking, fishing, or some other outdoor activity the fresh air
is all I need. Check out these [photos](/photos/) from some of my adventures!
